"""
Given a matrix with r rows and c columns, find the maximum score of a path starting at [0, 0] and ending at [r-1, c-1]. The score of a path is the minimum value in that path. For example, the score of the path 8 → 4 → 5 → 9 is 4.

Don't include the first or final entry. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example 1:

Input:
[[5, 1],
 [4, 5]]

Output: 4
Explanation:
Possible paths:
5 → 1 → 5 => min value is 1
5 → 4 → 5 => min value is 4
Return the max value among minimum values => max(4, 1) = 4.
Example 2:

Input:
[[1, 2, 3]
 [4, 5, 1]]

Output: 4
Explanation:
Possible paths:
1-> 2 -> 3 -> 1
1-> 2 -> 5 -> 1
1-> 4 -> 5 -> 1
So min of all the paths = [2, 2, 4]. Note that we don't include the first and final entry.
Return the max of that, so 4.
